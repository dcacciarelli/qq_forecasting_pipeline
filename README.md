# QQ Forecasting Pipeline

A modular and reproducible pipeline for univariate time series forecasting using ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer models. This repository is designed for plug-and-play usage on electricity demand data, but can be easily adapted to other time series datasets.

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores autoregressive forecasting models in a comparative framework:

- **ARIMA**: Classical linear model with seasonal extensions.
- **LSTM**: Recurrent neural network capable of learning temporal dependencies.
- **Transformer**: A causal, decoder-style transformer model with masked self-attention and positional encoding, tailored for univariate forecasting.

Experiments are run on UK national electricity demand data (NESO, 2025), with all models predicting one step ahead over a 7-day test window (336 half-hourly steps).
